      <li>Original problem solving</li>
      <li>Critical attention to detail</li>
      <li>Building analytical models to answer questions and automate processes</li>

    <h3>What My Boss Thought</h3>
    <p>In my most recent annual review, I received the following feedback from my manager:</p>
    <p> “Lindsay is the person to rely on to get it done right under the gun.  One of the best at delivering results. Nothing stands in her way, and she holds herself to a very high standard which drives the quality of her work… Lindsay continues to outperform as the go-to resource on most real estate strategic opportunities. She is an incredibly hard worker who demonstrates complete dedication to her job and career. I believe she provides us (mergers and real estate investment banking) more leverage than any other professional on our platform.” </p>
