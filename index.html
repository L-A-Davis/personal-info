    <h3>What My Boss Thought</h3>
    <p>In my most recent annual review, I received the following feedback from my manager:</p>
    <p> “Lindsay is the person to rely on to get it done right under the gun.  One of the best at delivering results. Nothing stands in her way, and she holds herself to a very high standard which drives the quality of her work… Lindsay continues to outperform as the go-to resource on most RE [merger] opportunities. She is an incredibly hard worker who demonstrates complete dedication to her job and career. I believe she provides us ([mergers] and REIB) more leverage than any other professional on our platform.” </p>

      <h3>Why Coding?</h3>
      <p>I believe coding will provide the opportunity to continue to build upon the things I loved about my job in banking...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Original problem solving</li>
        <li>Building something new or putting parts together in a unique way to address the question at hand</li>
        <li>Discipline of starting with an end goal and breaking the problem down to workable parts, testing the building blocks along the way</li>
        <li>Critical attention to detail</li>
        <li>Working towards the goal of simple perfection</li>
        <li>Ability to successfully complete projects under pressure</li>
        <li>Expereince buidling dynamic corporate models for clients to forecast financials and credit compliance based upon changing numerous factors</li>
     </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="left-side info coding" id="left-six">
    <h3>Ideas on Dynamic Financial Modeling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Long Term Vision: To automate all of the analysis currently done by financial analysts / associates in PE firms and investment banks</li>
      <li>Value Proposition: Accurate analyses produced efficiently from both a time and expense perspective</li>
      <li>How is it Done Currently?: New excel model is built for each situation, which is inefficient and error-prone</li>
      <li>Execution Plan: Start with returns models, basic merger models, fairness metrics</li>
          <li>Move on to complex corporate and highly structured transactions</li>
          <li>Eventually create dynamic links to source material such as databases or direct documents to remove manual information inputs</li>
      <li>How would it make Money?: Could be subscription-based, currently drafting more fulsome business plan</li>
