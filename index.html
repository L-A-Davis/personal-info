    <h3>What My Boss Thought</h3>
    <p>In my most recent annual review, I received the following feedback from my manager:</p>
    <p> “Lindsay is the person to rely on to get it done right under the gun.  One of the best at delivering results. Nothing stands in her way, and she holds herself to a very high standard which drives the quality of her work… Lindsay continues to outperform as the go-to resource on most real estate strategic opportunities. She is an incredibly hard worker who demonstrates complete dedication to her job and career. I believe she provides us (mergers and real estate investment banking) more leverage than any other professional on our platform.” </p>

      <h3>Why Coding?</h3>
      <p>I believe coding will provide the opportunity to continue to build upon the things I loved about my job in banking...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Original problem solving</li>
        <li>Building something new or putting parts together in a unique way to address the question at hand</li>
        <li>Discipline of starting with an end goal and breaking the problem down to workable parts, testing the building blocks along the way</li>
        <li>Critical attention to detail</li>
        <li>Working towards the goal of simple perfection</li>
        <li>Ability to successfully complete projects under pressure</li>
        <li>Experience building dynamic corporate models for clients to forecast financials and credit compliance based upon changing numerous factors</li>
     </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="left-side info coding" id="left-six">
    <h3>Ideas on Dynamic Financial Modeling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Long term vision:</span> To automate analysis currently done by financial analysts / associates in PE firms and investment banks</li>
      <li><span>Value proposition:</span> Accurate analyses produced efficiently from both a time and expense perspective</li>
      <li><span>How is it done currently?</span> New excel model is built for each situation, which is inefficient and error-prone</li>
      <li><span>Execution plan:</span> Start with returns models, basic merger models, fairness metrics</li>
          <ul>
          <li>Move on to complex corporate and highly structured transactions</li>
          <li>Eventually create dynamic, direct links to source material from databases or documents to remove manual information input</li>
        </ul>
      <li><span>How would it make money?</span> Could be subscription-based, currently drafting more fulsome business plan</li>

  <h3>Core Values</h3>
  <p>I know that only building relationships over time will demonstrate these but in telling you about myself, an important part of me is the principles I believe in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Integrity</span> – Be true to myself, uphold my principles and take care of things that are important to me</li>
    <li><span>Respect</span> – Treat everyone with it</li>
    <li><span>Excellence</span> – Continue to push myself to the best of my abilities</li>
    <li><span>Results</span> – Achieve goals I set out to meet</li>
    <li><span>Determination</span> – Expect that things will be hard and plan accordingly</li>
    <li><span>Creativity</span> – Think for myself, innovate and do not just accept the status quo - just because something is there, it does not mean it is right</li>
    <li><span>Positivity</span> – Anything I write here is going to sound corny but the point is that nothing is ever accomplished with a poor attitude</li>
